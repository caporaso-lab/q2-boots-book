# q2-boots ðŸ¥¾

q2-boots is a [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org) plugin providing bootstrapped and rarefaction-based (collectively, resampled) alpha and beta diversity analyses, designed to mirror the interface of q2-diversity.

```{admonition} Development status
:class: tip
q2-boots is in beta release. It is sufficiently validated and ready for real-world data analysis, but **interfaces are still subject to change**. For example, default parameter settings, command names, and outputs generated by specific commands may evolve as we get usability feedback and feature requests from users.
```

## Installing

### Step 1: Install prerequisites

{{ miniconda_url }} provides the `conda` environment and package manager, and is currently the only supported way to install QIIME 2.
Follow the instructions for downloading and installing Miniconda.

After installing Miniconda and opening a new terminal, make sure you're running the latest version of `conda`.

```bash
conda update conda
```

### Step 2: Install q2-boots

`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} 2024.10.beta release
Installing the release version of q2-boots allows you to access the most stable version of the functionality in a QIIME 2 2024.10 release environment.
This is most convenient if you need to reference a specific version of q2-boots in a publication (you would refer to it as the *2024.10.beta release of q2-boots*.)
Since q2-boots is still under active development, there may be some new functionality that isn't included in this release.

```shell
conda env create \
  -n q2-boots-2024.10.beta \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qiime2/q2-boots/main/environment-files/q2-boots-qiime2-amplicon-2024.10.yml
```

```shell
conda activate q2-boots-2024.10.beta
```
````

````{tab-item} Latest development version
Installing the most recent development version of q2-boots allows you to access the most recent functionality, including some that depends on features being introduced in the 2025.4 version of the QIIME 2 Framework. ðŸ”§
Referencing specific versions of q2-boots is still possible --- just be sure to hang on to your QIIME 2 `Results` and/or `Visualizations`, so you can review the specific revisions (including git commit hashes) in your data provenance.

```shell
conda env create \
  -n q2-boots-2025.4.dev \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qiime2/q2-boots/main/environment-files/q2-boots-qiime2-amplicon-2025.4.yml
```

```shell
conda activate q2-boots-2025.4.dev
```
````
`````

## Using

After completing the install steps above, you can review the top-level q2-boots help text by running:

```shell
qiime boots --help
```

To view the help text for a specific command, including executable usage examples, you can run:

```shell
qiime boots core-metrics --help
```

This will display the help text for the `core-metrics` command.
Notice the usage examples at the bottom of the help text - these are a good starting point for your commands.
Calling `core-metrics` with the `--example-data` parameter will write the corresponding example data to a directory you specify for you to test or experiment with as you figure out how you want to use the command.
For example:

```shell
qiime boots core-metrics --example-data cm-example-data
```

will write example input data to a new `cm-example-data` directory.
That directory will contain a sub-directory per usage example:

```shell
cm-example-data
â”œâ”€â”€ Bootstrapped core metrics.
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.tsv
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ table.qza
â””â”€â”€ Rarefaction-based core metrics.
    â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.tsv
    â””â”€â”€ table.qza
```

Notice that the subdirectory names align with names of the usage examples in the core-metrics `--help` text.
Change into one of those directories and run the corresponding usage example to test out the command.
You can then adapt the usage example commands to apply to your own data.

Once you've figured out how you want to use q2-boots on your data, you can run `Pipelines` in parallel by including the `--parallel` flag in your commands:

```shell
qiime boots core-metrics --parallel ...
```

Pipeline resumption will work in the background, unless you pass `--no-recycle`, allowing you to restart failed runs without needing to recompute results that had already completed.

```{note}
The default parallel configuration changed between versions 2024.5 and 2024.10 of the QIIME 2 Framework.
Parallel configuration will require a little more setup in the 2024.5.beta release of q2-boots - reach out on the QIIME 2 Forum if you're interested in doing this and we'll help out.
If you're using the `--parallel` option with the 2024.10 development release of QIIME 2, you're all set.
```

Have fun! ðŸ˜Ž

## About `q2-boots`

`q2-boots` was developed for a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science project at [Northern Arizona University (NAU)](https://www.nau.edu), and will be maintained by the [Caporaso Lab](https://cap-lab.bio) at NAU.
If you use q2-boots in published work, please cite it as referenced here {cite}`Raspet2024`.

`q2-boots` was derived from content in the [QIIME 2 plugin template](https://develop.qiime2.org/en/latest/plugins/tutorials/create-from-template.html) (q2-boots existed before the plugin template, so didn't use it directly).
To learn how to use `q2-boots`, refer to the [plugin documentation](https://q2-boots.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
To learn how to use QIIME 2, refer to the [QIIME 2 User Documentation](https://docs.qiime2.org).
To learn QIIME 2 plugin development, refer to [*Developing with QIIME 2*](https://develop.qiime2.org).

`q2-boots` is a QIIME 2 *community plugin*.
While this plugin is developed in the Caporaso Lab, community plugins in general are not necessarily developed and maintained by the developers of QIIME 2.
Because community plugins are developed by the QIIME 2 developer community, and not necessarily the QIIME 2 developers themselves, some may not be actively maintained or compatible with current release versions of the QIIME 2 distributions.
More information on development and support for community plugins can be found [here](https://library.qiime2.org).
